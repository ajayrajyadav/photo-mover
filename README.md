photo-mover
===========

Quick script I wrote to move photos to a year / month / day hierarchy based on EXIF data or date at start of file name.

Will search the origin directory and any sub-directories for image files


HOW TO USE
----------
> npm install

> node app.js --origin /Users/jeremiah/Dropbox/Camera\ Uploads/ --destination /Users/jeremiah/Pictures/
